            Life can be challenging at times and cause us to feel stuck, unhappy, and overwhelmed. We sometimes may
            feel confused and discouraged on how to improve our lives.  In the midst of these difficult periods, we may
            benefit from having a supportive space to explore what makes us unhappy, challenge ourselves, gain insight,
            learn new skills, and explore new ways of being. I am happy to meet with you to figure out if I can be the
            person who can support you in this journey.

            to my clients to help them overcome their barriers to experience life in more fulfilling ways.

            I have extensive experience working with issues including depression, anxiety, relationships and conflict

          <h2>BIO</h2>
          <br/>
          <p class="h5 text-muted">
            I received my Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from University of Massachusetts Boston following a terminal
            master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling. I completed my APA Accredited internship at University of
            Connecticut Counseling and Mental Health Services and fulfilled my post-doctoral fellowship at Boston College
            University Counseling Services. Upon completing my training, I worked as a staff psychologist at Tufts
            University Counseling and Mental Health Service. I have over five years of clinical experience.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="h5 text-muted">
            I have extensive clinical experience at college counseling centers that have helped me develop my identity
            as a generalist, with skills in brief and long-term individual therapy, group therapy, diverse populations,
            crisis management, outreach, and assessment. I have been providing long-term and short-term individual
            therapy to a diverse population with respect to race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity,
            nationality, and socioeconomic status. I work with a variety of presenting issues such as depression,
            anxiety, eating disorders, identity issues, relationship problems, vocational issues, developmental
            concerns, and stress management. I also have experience working with underserved youth who presented with
            a wide range of behavioral, social, and emotional challenges. This experience contributed to my understanding
            of adolescent development and helped me gain knowledge and experience in substance abuse issues.

            I have special interest in issues of cultural and diversity issues; complex trauma and resilience; identity
            development; attachment; interpersonal conflict and close relationships; and personal, social, emotional,
            and vocational development during emerging adulthood and beyond.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="h5 text-muted">
            My approach emphasizes genuineness, respect for the individual, and compassion. I strive to provide a safe
            and empowering environment for my clients.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="h5 text-muted">
            As an international person/immigrant myself, I am particularly interested in working with immigrants and
            international people. I also provide therapy in Turkish.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="h5 text-muted">
            Besides my clinical experiences, I have also been actively involved in teaching and research. I teach master’s
            level abnormal psychology, assessment, vocational counseling, research, and ethics courses as Adjunct
            Faculty at UMass Boston. I have conducted extensive research on developmental issues and well-being of
            emerging adults (ages 18-29). These experiences tremendously contribute to my clinical work.

          <h2>Individual Therapy</h2>
          <br/>
          <p class="text-muted">
            In my clinical practice, I believe in the power of constructive relationships, which provide unconditional
            positive regard, genuineness and empathy, in promoting the well-being of individuals and society. I follow
            an integrative relational psychodynamic approach, which integrates cognitive-behavioral, systemic,
            multicultural/feminist, and experiential concepts. The relational approach sets the foundation of my
            interactions with my clients and facilitates the therapeutic alliance, which I believe, is the catalyst of
            change and healing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            To be effective therapists, we must engage in continuous self-reflection of our reactions, assumptions, and
            beliefs, since all human interactions are a dynamic two-way process. Thus, I consider what is happening in
            the therapy room and the interaction between my clients and myself as an integral part of the process.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Furthermore, problems do not occur exclusively within the individual; they emerge in a context through the
            interaction between internal and external influences. The meaning-making processes embedded in one’s culture
            and systems that make up the individual’s context are the core of psychological difficulties. In the process
            of change, I try to understand the meaning of my clients’ behaviors, emotions, and thoughts from a contextual
            perspective.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Change occurs when we embrace and experience our difficult emotions and work through them. My goal is to
            facilitate my clients to retell their stories with newly constructed insights and meanings, so that they
            integrate newly constructed behavior, emotions, and cognitions. In this realm, my role is to join my
            client’s experience; provide genuine curiosity in their stories; trust their capacity to gain insight
            and to change; and establish a safe space in which we co-construct experience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            I have extensive clinical experience at college counseling centers that have helped me develop my identity
            as a generalist, with skills in brief and long-term individual therapy, group therapy, diverse populations,
            crisis management, outreach, and assessment. I have been providing long-term and short-term individual
            therapy to a diverse population with respect to race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity,
            nationality, and socioeconomic status. I work with a variety of presenting issues such as depression,
            anxiety, eating disorders, identity issues, relationship problems, vocational issues, developmental
            concerns, and stress management. I also have experience working with underserved youth who presented with
            a wide range of behavioral, social, and emotional challenges. This experience contributed to my understanding
            of adolescent development and helped me gain knowledge and experience in substance abuse issues.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h2>Couples Therapy</h2>
          <br/>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Close relationships are complicated. We start relationships with hope that we will partner in life with all
            of its challenges. However, both our personal patterns and our relational patterns can interfere with our
            relationship satisfaction. This may result in resentment, disappointment, and overall dissatisfaction with
            our lives. I facilitate my clients to identify patterns in their relationship, improve their ways of
            communication, and find ways to experience a more fulfilling relationship.  I am particularly interested
            in facilitating my clients to preserve their sense of self, “I”, while developing a “We".
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            In some cases, couples might find themselves at a crossroads to decide what they would like to do with
            their relationship. Making a decision about continuing or ending a relationship can also be challenging.
            Couples therapy can also help with making a decision about your relationship.
